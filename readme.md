# JolBondhu: Empowering Farmers Against the Tide

## 🌾 Overview

**JolBondhu** is an AI-driven _Agri-Guardian_ designed to protect smallholder farmers in flood-prone regions of Bangladesh.

By synthesizing real-time hydrological data with historical flood patterns, JolBondhu converts complex climate signals into **clear decisions**—helping farmers protect crops, livestock, and livelihoods.

## 🚩 Problem Statement

Flooding is one of the most devastating climate risks faced by Bangladeshi farmers:

- Generic flood alerts lack field-level relevance
- Farmers receive warnings too late or without guidance
- Crop loss, livestock death, and food insecurity follow

Smallholder farmers need **early, understandable, and practical advice**, not raw data.

---

## 💡 Solution

JolBondhu bridges the gap between **advanced hydrological data** and **on-ground farming decisions**.

- Generates **3–5 day localized flood risk forecasts**
- Classifies risk into **Low / Medium / High** levels

Rather than saying _"a flood may occur"_, JolBondhu says:

> _Delay rice transplanting by 3 days_ > _Move cattle to higher ground_ > _Secure stored grain immediately_
